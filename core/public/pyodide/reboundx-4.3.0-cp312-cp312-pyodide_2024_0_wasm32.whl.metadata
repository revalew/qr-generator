Welcome to REBOUNDx (eXtras)
============================

REBOUNDx allows you to easily incorporate additional physics into your REBOUND simulations.
The main code is written in C, and we provide a convenient Python wrapper.
For an overview of the technical details and some practical recommendations, see `Tamayo, Rein, Shi and Hernandez 2019 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05634>`_.
The paper publication lines up with REBOUNDx version 3.0.0.

Documentation
=============

For a list of supported effects, and descriptions of the parameters that need to be set for each effect, see the documentation at `https://reboundx.readthedocs.io <https://reboundx.readthedocs.io>`_.
You can also find installation instructions and a quickstart guide there.

Attribution
===========

We have tried to structure the documentation in a way that makes it easy to credit the various people who have contributed to any given effect.
